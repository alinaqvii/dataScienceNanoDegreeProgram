Recap
You are so ready to take on this project! I hope you are excited to create your own post! There was a lot to take away from this lesson. Here were the big points I had in mind:

Related to Marketing Yourself
Catchy image followed by a catchy title.


Write in small blocks of text, as large blocks of text will exhaust and demotivate your reader.


Start with an engaging question or current event that your audience is likely thinking about.


End with a recap and a call to action.


Related to Keeping Yourself and Your Reader Motivated
Keep your post short and sweet. 1-2 pages per post will increase audience engagement, as well as the likelihood you complete the writing of your post.


Create an outline. A useful outline for your post could just be: introduction, each of your questions, and then a conclusion. This will help you stay focused when writing your post.


Review. Review. Review. When you think you have reviewed enough, find someone else to review. The more review you have of your work, the better it will become.

The three Text portions of this class contain A LOT of useful information. Use them for reference as you complete your project, and as you continue to write more posts in the future!
